Documentation
We use two python modules in this project
    HandTrackingModule.py: Has the user defined class that will recognize the hands
    of the user and perform other operations on it.

        class HandDetector
            attributes:
                hands: represents the "Hands" object created using Hands class from the mediapipe library.
                It processes an RGB image and returns the hand landmarks of each detected hand.
            methods: 
                findHands: function to find hands
                If a hand is found, it will draw hand landmarks over them and return the edited image.

                findPosition: If a hand is detected it finds the position of the hand landmarks. And returns a nested list of their coordinates.

    main.py: The main script that is run.

    It uses the following functions

        thumbIncrementCheck(lmList: list[list[int]]): Checks whether your thumb is up or not. No matter what hand you use. Returns 1 if thumb is up else 0

        textOutput(count, cc): Returns an appropriate text output depending on `count` and `cc`.

        main(): The function that is evoked when main.py is run.

        1) Access the devices' camera to get images.
        2) Initialize a HandDetector object called "detector".
        3) Within an infinite loop
            1) read image from the camera and feed it into findHands() method of "detector"
            2) feed the edited image into findPosition() method and get the list of coordinates of the detected hand
            3) if hand exists, then collect data on what fingers are up or down in variables "count" and "cc"
            4) detect what hand sign is shown using textOutput() function
            5) put the name of the detected shape in the image and show it
